# Party Pigeon

A simple tcp-like custom protocol server that I am building from scratch in C to test my skills and become more familiar with
low level languages.

This program is essentially divided into two key components:
    - The "wing" protocol library which will contain code for server and client connections
    - The "PartyPigeon" app which will let users connect to a server to send messages

## TODO:
    - Build and learn about a propper Makefile
    - Finish the project
